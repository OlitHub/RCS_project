# Project - Refresher in Computer science

![Our beautiful wallpaper](https://github.com/olithub/RCS_project/blob/main/data/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

## Description

We want to develop a Python application that reads the above picture (as a .png file) in a low resolution, to generate a scalable version (as a .svg file) that can be used as a high-resolution wallpaper for your computer. To do so, we intend to sample the colors of each hexagone to reproduce the same picture.
